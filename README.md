## Talk.Show.Host
### a DIA for sharing and exploring public opinions
A new standard for expressing public opinions online from the generation that knows memes best and how to game as well as avoid the pit-falls of the socio-dopaminergic feedback traps set by early 21st century social networks.

### Getting Started
#### user packages

1. Go to http://houseofven.us/tsh in your mobile browser to access the pre-version-1.0.0 releases. For the full application (v 1.0.0 and up) buy the application on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. You can access the application for free via a cARd.
2. Tap "TALK" or "SHOW" to begin.
3. If on "TALK": react to the topic or news item presented on screen through a personally recorded video. Users can skip up to three prompts in a row. User responses are recorded by tapping the timer at the bottom; there are no pauses. The total amount of time spent in this section per round is 60 seconds.
4. If on "SHOW": react to the video presented on screen by swiping left or right. Videos sent left are "ignored" or "trashed" whereas those sent right are "saved" in a collection for later use. Users see 60 seconds total of content at once, with extra time alloted for transitions (up to one second each) extending the range of the total viewing session per round from 61 to 120 seconds.
5. After cataloguing six minutes worth of content by cyclicng through "TALK" and "SHOW", the "HOST" section becomes available and USERs can select it.
6. In the "HOST" section, the USER is presented with all of the content they "saved" over the course of the previous session and are instructed to preserve a minute's worth of content. After picking, the USER is randomly assigned to a group of six other USERs to act as HOSTs in a live stream criticizing the content they each selected. This se


#### developer packages
Developer bundles of Talk.Show.Host are available via the cARd or through text commands to the House of Venus TreeHouse Distributed Ledger.


### Prerequisites
#### To use the application you will need:
* a WiFi-enabled smartphone
* a mobile web browser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome) or a mobile application store (Apply App Store, Google Play Store)

#### To use the developer bundles you will need:
* a WiFi-enabled, NFC-reading smartphone
* a mobile web browser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome)
* (If using desktop instead of mobile): Command Line Shell (Terminal, PowerShell, etc.)

### Installing
The appeal of tinkering with the developer packages of Talk.Show.Host or tsh is the core package's flexibility. It has the potential to be applied to a variety of video editing applications from simple editing to live video conferencing. Fundamentally, tsh is a Lifestream sourced from the recorded inputs ("TALK", "HOST") of tsh USERs who filter said inputs using non-reflexive ("SHOW") and semi-non-reflexive ("HOST") methods.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks

+ Or pluses

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
